\section{Camera Theory}

An image captured through a camera is the result of photons being detected on a sensor. If you have no previous experience in image processing these subjects might not be familiar to you. In this chapter the basics of how a camera functions will be explained. To understand this it is necessary to have a rudimentary understanding of the physics behind light.

To visualize Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Photons are small packets of energy, that can be described by three properties:



\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Wavelenght} - Measured in meters from wave top to wave top, denoted $\lambda$
\item \textbf{Frequency} - Measured in oscillations per second, denoted Hz
\item \textbf{Energy} - Measured in electronvolts, denoted eV
\end{itemize}
