\section{Problem statement}
Is it possible to make an interactive piece of software that fits into the environment of Hjørring Library? The program should meet the following sets of requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item Low maintenance: the program should be easy set up and use for the library staff.
\item Fits with the theme of Hjørring Library during December: Christmas. The program should be ready before December.
\item The program should be engaging for short periods of time, as well as for multiple uses.
\item The program should use OpenCV for loading in images, but all of the image processing functionality should be written by the group.
\end{itemize}
