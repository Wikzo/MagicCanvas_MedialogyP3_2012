\section{Setting up the project at Hj{\o}rring Library}
On the last weeks of the project, the group finally decided to show up at Hj{\o}rring Library to set up the project in order to test it and make the final arrangements. As said before in the report, the program requires a canvas illuminated from behind, an infrared camera and a projector.
