\subsection{Setting up the project at Hj{\o}rring Library}
On the last weeks of the project, the group finally decided to show up at Hj{\o}rring Library to setup the project in order to test it and make the final arrangements. The project itself requires a canvas, some illumination from LEDs, an infrared camera and a projector.
