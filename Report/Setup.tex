\section{Setup at Hj{\o}rring Library}
The initial steps of the setup was to determine the location at the library where the installation would be located. The library offered a series of different locations. The chosen location is in the middle of the library. The main reason for this choice was that the area had artificial lighting and the area is also the most direct path from the entrance to the working area and the children's area. In figure \ref{fig:library_floorplans} the layout of the library is shown along with the designated project area.

%During the last weeks of the project, the group setup the project at Hj{\o}rring Library in order to test it and make the final arrangements. The project itself requires a canvas, some illumination from infrared LEDs, an infrared camera and a projector.

\textbf{This does not make sense to me? - Gustav}
Before the actual installation, a model of the setup was created and discussed. The area selected provides a place for the projector, since a broad sturdy row of shelves facing a the wall where the canvas will be deployed. Between the projecter and the canvas there is a long display case, this will be used to mount a strip of infrared LEDs. In figure \ref{fig:setup_model_person} the setup is illustrated:

\begin{itemize}
\item Canvas is red
\item LED strip is purple
\item Camera with IR filter is blue, its field of view is outlined.
\item The projector is faded green, its field of projection is outlined.
\end{itemize}

\item LEDs strips

The first step on the construction of the Canvas was to position two LEDs strips in order to get the desired illumination for the infrared camera. As the placement of this project is a corridor divided by a red shelve that crosses the whole library, it was decided to add one strip on the lower part of this shelve and another LED stripes on the background covered by the canvas (see picture \ref{fig:LEDsPosition}).

The construction of these LEDs stripes was made as simple as possible in order to lighten the weight. So finally the stripes were tapped to the shelves with duct tape. The solutions can be seen on Fig. \ref{fig:RealLEDs} and \ref{fig:RealRedLEDs}.

\item Building the Canvas

For the projection it was decided to use a sheet to cover the
