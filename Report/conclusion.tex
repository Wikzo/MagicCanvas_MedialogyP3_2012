\chapter{Conclusion}
After the completion of the project, it is time to conclude on the experiences and new knowledge achieved. In the beginning of the report a problem definition was made and this chapter will conclude on the content, showing how the different issues were addressed.

Below the problem definition is included together with answers on how this was solved in the project. The parts from the problem definition will be illustrated by bullet points \\
\textbf{It was decided in the group that in order to succeed the following sets of requirements should be meet.} 

\begin{itemize}
\item Low maintenance: the program should be easy set up and use for the library staff.
\end{itemize}

Low maintenance is a key factor, and is important as setting up the installation should not take much of the staff at the library's time. This was solved by making it as simple as possible. The only thing that is required from the staff is to press three buttons to turn on the setup. This is explained in a three stepped guide:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Press button 1 - on/off button for electricity for the setup.
\item Press button 2 - on/off button on the projector.
\item Press button 3 - on/off button on the computer.
\end{enumerate}

Once these three steps are completed the computer will start up and automatically open a batch file when Windows starts. This batch file opens the program which will initialize itself. Then after 15 seconds it will open Unity and the magic canvas is ready to use. This is a very satisfying step for the group and the staff at the library.\\ 
When turning off the installation, the same three steps are to be followed only in reverse order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Press button 1 - on/off button on the computer.
\item Press button 2 - on/off button on the projector (Do this twice to turn it off).
\item Press button 3 - on/off button for electricity for the setup.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{itemize}
\item Fits the theme of Hj{\o}rring Library during December: Christmas. The program should be ready for the beginning of December.
\end{itemize}
To make the installation fit into the theme of Hj{\o}rring Library during December, the Christmas theme was brought into the project. The graphics should give a Christmas feel, bringing in some of the known Christmas symbols - such as snow and Christmas trees, but also some Christmas characters such as pixies and a snowman.\\
When running the testing visitors of the library was asked whether the installation were fitting inside the library, and almost everyone answered that it did indeed fit into the library and it's theme.
Besides the Christmas theme, Hj{\o}rring Library is known for being very interactive which fits perfect into our theme. With all this being said it can be concluded that the project fits the library and its Christmas theme very well.
\begin{itemize}
\item It should be engaging for short periods of time, as well as for multiple uses. Multiple people should be able to use it simultaneously.
\end{itemize}
The installation gives the opportunity for the user to chose how much time they want to spend on it. There is no ending so it is not required for you to spend a certain amount of time. \\
The user will be able to just walk past the canvas seeing the character move, and then if he/she finds it entertaining then it is possible to play with, walking back and forth controlling the character. The fact that there are multiple characters which comes randomly makes it interesting to play with more than just once.\\
As for multiple persons using it simultaneously this works. The only problem is some errors if more persons walks too close to each other, since they will be recognized as one person instead of multiple persons.
\begin{itemize}
\item The program would be written in C++ and using the OpenCV library for reading/writing images, but all of the image processing functionality should be written by the group.
\end{itemize}
All image processing functionality was written by the group itself, and the OpenCV library was only used to read images. However the code was not written in C++ only. All image processing was written in C++ but the visualisation is done in the program Unity using C\# code.

\textbf{Is it possible to make an interactive piece of software that fits into the environment of Hj{\o}rring Library?}\\
As this project proves - it is indeed possible. This project has shown that it is possible to make an interactive piece of software that fits into Hj{\o}rring library's environment.\\
Answers from interviews of test persons proved that Hj{\o}rring library is a great location for such a project, however it should be more highlighted to get more attention. \\
The project period has been a positive experience for the group, but also for the library. It has been a great experience to work professionally with a real library, and it encouraged the group to work even harder to get a good product. The pressure it lays on your shoulders to have to hand in a working product is a great motivation for working hard. \\
As mentioned it was a great experience for the library as well. In the mail attached below the library staff tells how this has been a valuable experience for them.

Tak tak, det skal vi nok klare!\\

Og tak for jeres indsats!\\
M{\aa}ske f{\o}ler I at det drukner lidt i alt jullehall{\o}jet her hos os, men for os er det en v{\ae}rdifuld erfaring. Som I kan se s{\aa} er de andre juletiltag og udstillinger lidt mere traditionelle og mere til at kigge p{\aa}. Og for os, og brugerne, er det vigtigt at vi er {\aa} alsidige som muligt, og hele tiden afpr{\o}ver nyt.\\

Med venlig hilsen
