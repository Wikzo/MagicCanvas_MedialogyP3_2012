\section{Introduction to Testing}
Testing is a really important part of the project. It is a great opportunity to get an impression of how the users experience the product. It is specially important because the users might be able to find problems that it is hard to find as creator of a product. \\
The test can give different results, but no results is more correct than others. Maybe the users like the project and it is a success. Maybe there are small errors that the users would like to be changed. It is also possible that the users do not like the project at all, and call it a failed attempt. No matter what the result is then the critique is always useful. Since the critique comes directly from the users of the product then they should be taken seriously and all proposals should be taken into consideration. 

The testing of the installation will take place at Hj{\o}rring Library where the product is being exhibited. The running of the test will be described in the next section.
