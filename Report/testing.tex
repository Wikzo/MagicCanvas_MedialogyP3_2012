\section{Running the test}
Running the test will be a bipartite task, as one team will focus towards monitoring peoples habits, gender and ages, while another group will interview users and present a questionnaire.
\subsection{Observation}
In regards to observing, two persons from the group will be present at the setup to observe people walking by. One will focus on people using the setup actively and one will focus on people using the setup on a passive level.\\
The members present will take notes in regards to formalities such as gender and age, in order to to determine if there are tendencies of a certain group of people who avoid interacting in the setup e.g.\\
In addition the group present at the setup will note down how people react to the installation and how they engage. It's of importance to find pattern in the way people interact and look for tendencies; in order to improve the product. Considering the scenario that three quarters of the people who engage actively in the installing gather around the center and remain static, the program should provide some feedback that will make people move.

\subsection{Handing out questionnaires}
The second group of the testers will be stationed of either side of the installation, to ask people who walked by the installation to participate in answering some simple  questions. People will be kindly asked if they are interested in giving some feedback to improve the user experience and given a reward in form of "Pebbern√∏dder or brunkager", as a friendly gesture.\\
The idea of placing two members on either side of the installation is in order to gather information after they have had the chance to engage in the setup. The questionnaire will look the following:

\textbf{Questionnaire}
\begin{itemize}
\item Active users
\begin{itemize}
\item Why did you visit the library today?
\item Does the installation fit in the theme of the library?
\item Why did you use the installation at the library?
\item What can be done to improve the product and the overall experience?
\end{itemize}
\item Passive users
\begin{itemize}
\item Why did you visit the library today?
\item Does the installation fit in the theme of the library?
\item Why did you not use the installation at the library?
\item What can be done to make you engage in the installation?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Running a user test}
The second task of the testing is to run a user test which main focus will be to evaluate the installation. 

\textbf{User Test}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tracking
\begin{itemize}
\item Fidelity test
\item Number of simultaneous tracking
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
