\section{Appendix C: Library visit November 19}\label{targetgroup_visit}
\textbf{Tools we need}
\begin{itemize}
\item Record equipment (for timelapse)
\item Both IR and normal webcam
\item Canvas with reference points
\end{itemize}

\textbf{General agenda}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Look at the setting (light etc.)
\item Where to setup the camera and do we have a region of interest?
\item Observation on raw people - record timelapse.
\item Initial test setup - see how people react, and if we need anything for the system to work better
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Talk with people}

How do they experience the library? Do they like the concept of "an experience place"? Do they want to stay there and hang out? Casual?

Are they in a hurry, going from A to B quickly, or do they want to walk around and browse?

Did you notice the camera?
- How did being recorded make you feel?

Measure what their "Christmas mood" is
