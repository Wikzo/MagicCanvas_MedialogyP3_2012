\section{Edge definition}
An edge in an image is basically a place in an image where there is a contrast.

\citet{visual_story} describes an edge as the apparent line around the borders of a two-dimensional object.

Another definition is given by \citep{ip_book} who writes that an edge in an image is defined as a position where there is a significant change in gray-level values.
