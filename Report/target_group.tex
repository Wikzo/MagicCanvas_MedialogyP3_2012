\chapter{Target Group Analysis}

In this chapter we will investigate the target group of the project. A preliminary assessment will be made, and we will gather information that will help towards the ultimate goal of identifying any special requirements the target group demands. This will consist of three steps; Identifying our target group, describing the target group and compiling and concluding our results.

\section{Identifying out target group}
The preliminary identification of the target group is easily accomplished in this project, as the final installation will be available for all visitors at Hj{\o}rring Library. 
\fxnote{we might want to expand a bit on this}

\section{Description of Target Group}
Upon visiting the library it becomes apparent that \textit{visitors} covers a very large demographic. There are people ranging in age from toddlers, to senior citizens and everything in between. During a small series (sample size was 22 people) of qualitative interviews the group gathered information about the visitors at the library. The tendency was that the youngest children were there with their parents to play, while teens used the library as a free-space while waiting for the bus or simply to spend some time with each other. The middle-aged people that were interviewed used the library simple to rent material, and did not use the spaces in the same way that the younger visitors did.
