\chapter{Target group analysis}
In this chapter we will investigate the target group of the project. A preliminary assessment will be made, and we will gather information that will help towards the ultimate goal of identifying any special requirements the target group demands. This will consist of three steps; Identifying our target group, describing the target group and compiling and concluding our results.

\section{Hj{\o}rring Library}
Hj{\o}rring Library aims to be distinguish itself from most other Danish libraries. This is seen by the fact that it is located inside a big shopping mall, and by their passion for being interactive. Among other things the library has its own cafeteria and bar where people can show up and eat their lunch, drink coffee or have a beer after work. The architecture also appears very modern; everything is in one big room, and there are many places for people to entertain themselves with other things than just traditional books. \\ Hj{\o}rring Library wants to be a place where people can "hang out" and relax, but also have fun or work. There are many unique pieces of furniture, creating a great environment for all purposes, and especially kids can have a fun time playing games (physical and digital) and record videos in the children zone.

Hj{\o}rring Library gets more than 1000 visitors every day, and the goal is to give them a new and exiting experience every time they visit. One way to achieve this is by having various themes that run throughout the whole library, changing every six weeks. These includes topics such as: Arabia, birds, fairy tales and "brown." The library will be decorated after these themes, so for example while the bird-theme was running all kinds of birds was exhibited around in the library, and bird songs was playing on speakers around the library.\\
These themes is an example of Hj{\o}rring Library eager to be experienced as the idea of serendipity, which basically describes a happy accident; something you didn't expect but turned out to be a pleasant surprise.

Hj{\o}rring Library is always looking for new projects that involves its visitors in new and engaging ways. Previously they have had Medialogy students come and do projects, and it turned out to be a success, so they are eager to try it out again. This is where our group comes into the picture. To us, this is a great opportunity to collaborate with a institution on a project in a "real-life" setting where people outside of the university will interact with our product.

In the period of this project Library Hj{\o}rring has chosen the topic of Christmas. This theme runs from the second week of November until the last week of December, 2012.

\subsection{Visitor data and placement of the canvas}
The library is divided into several parts, each aiming to give a different experience. As mentioned earlier it was important to the group that the placement of the canvas was in a central location. This would ensure that a lot of people would have the chance to interact with the program. In fact, the bookshelves we choose are just in the middle of the library, so it is almost impossible to not walk past it at some point (see figure \ref{fig:library_floorplans}).

In 2010, \citep{hjoerring_study} did a survey to investigate people's habits and movement pattern at Hj{\o}rring Library. The found that an average visitor spends about half an hour at the library. Those in the age group between 0-10 years and 21-30 years spent most time, 34 and 44 minutes, while those between 41-50 and 61-70 years only spent 19 and 26 minutes during a visit.

Several cylinder and flow maps were made to visualize the gathered data, as shown in figures \ref{fig:library_cylindermap} and \ref{fig:library_flowmap}.

\section{Identifying the target group}
The preliminary identification of the target group is easily accomplished in this project, as the final installation will be available for all visitors at Hj{\o}rring Library. Upon visiting the library it becomes apparent that \textit{visitors} covers a very large demographic. There are people ranging in age from toddlers, to senior citizens and everything in between. To avoid limiting the installation to a specific part of the visitors at the library, the target group was kept as \textit{all visitors}.
\fxnote{we might want to expand a bit on this}

\section{Description of the target group}
During a small series (sample size was 22 people) of qualitative interviews the group gathered information about the visitors at the library. We were able to gather some information, and use this to create 4 groups that we will use to categorize our target audience:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Group 1} \textit{Small children}, the youngest group, were there because their parents enjoyed utilizing the facilities that the library offers.

\item \textbf{Group 2} \textit{Teens and youngsters} enjoyed spending time at the library while waiting for busses, this gave them the opportunity to enjoy each others company and make use of the computer, video games etc. that the library offers.

\item \textbf{group 3} \textit{Students} used the library for work, finding literature for reports and writing there.

\item \textbf{Group 4} Most \textit{adult visitors} used the library to rent material, and not much else.

\end{itemize}

As well as the interviews, we made several observations during the visit. The most active part (using the facilities provided by the library) of visitors at the library was by far the younger part. While the very youngest children were there with their parents, and would not benefit from an interactive installation. It is our belief that the teens and youngsters that use the facilities already offered by the library; computers, video games consoles and the other interactive toys \fxnote{maybe find a better wording for other interactive toys} will be the group that would enjoy an additional interactive installation the most.

Generally the tone at the library is that of any other library, and as such the visitors, mainly students and adult visitors naturally expect a quite and calm working area.

\section{Compilation and conclusion}

It is clear that the visitors at the library are a diverse group, that all use the library in different ways. When considering an interactive installation in the library, the group that would have the greatest interest in such a thing, is the group that also currently use the most of the unique facilities offered by the library; the teens and youngsters. But it, as mentioned before, important for us to accommodate all groups, so as not to exclude anyone from the audience or end up with too narrow a focus.
\\
While we state that a particular group might spend more time on the product, it is important for us to accommodate the other visitors as well. We will not target teens and youngster specifically, but there will be certain affordances that likely will appeal more to this group than the others.
\\
It is also a goal for the finished project fit into a library without disturbing visitors that to not wish to interact with the installation. This means that the final product will not having any sounds that causes more disturbance than someone walking by, coughing or having a normal conversation - as you would expect in a library.
\fxnote{what do we end up with? any sounds at all, correct this part to correspond to the final product. Might also be dangerous writing this, as you could argue that we might have to categorize sounds}
\\
In order for the installation to be a fun experience for both a casual by-passer as well as a more interested user, the final product will function on more than one level, this means that you can pass by and admire the installation and you will also be able to spend more time in front of it.
