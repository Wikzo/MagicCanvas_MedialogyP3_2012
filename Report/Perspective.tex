\chapter{Perspective}

In the program's current state, it would be relatively simple to change the graphics, making the installation fit other themes than Christmas. Also, more awareness about it could be gained by placing information banners close to the canvas, describing what the project is about.

During the development of the Magic Canvas, several ideas for improvements arose. When performing the tests is was clear that people wanted more ways to interact with the installation, such as using their arms and legs. Multiple or more sophisticated cameras could be used gain more possibilities. 

There are also multiple ways that the concept could be expanded upon. As mentioned in \ref{sec:collab} an early idea was to scan books. Now that the project is finished this still seems like an idea that could be worked on in the future. One could image a more game-like program where people were encouraged to go out and explore their local libraries. This could be coupled with learning material from the library to create a setting for playful learning.
